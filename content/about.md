Hello! My name is **Micah Weston** and I use they/she pronouns. I am an Honors Computer Engineering and Computer Science
student at Northeastern University on tract to graduate May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science and two co-ops. After that I
will complete a Master of Science in Computer Science within a year.

At university, I contributed code to a Multi-GPU simulator used for research. This opportunity was possible through the
mentoring I received from grad students of the _NU Computer Architecture Research Lab_.

On top of research, I've started contributing to LLVM with occasional patches, such
as [machine instruction combine in the AArch64 backend](https://reviews.llvm.org/D117429 "LLVM Patch Review"). I love
system programming, computer architecture, and other low-level details. Most of my time is spent in my favorite language
C++ but I also frequently use Haskell and Rust.

When I have the time, I love playing electric guitar and bass, reading non-fiction books, and analyzing code generation
on Godbolt\'s [Compiler Explorer.](https://godbolt.org/ "Compiler Explorer")

Once I graduate, I hope to become a compiler engineer. However, I have not completely ruled out becoming a guitarist in
a metal band.
