Hello! My name is **Micah Weston** and I use they/she pronouns. I am a compiler engineer at Microsoft working on AI
accelerators.

In 2024, I graduated from Northeastern University with a Master of Science in Computer Science. The prior year, I
graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering and Computer Science from Northeastern University.
During my time in college, I contributed code to a Multi-GPU simulator used for research. This opportunity was
possible through the mentoring I received from grad students of the _NU Computer Architecture Research Lab_.

On top of research, I've started contributing to LLVM with occasional patches, such
as [machine instruction combine in the AArch64 backend](https://reviews.llvm.org/D117429 "LLVM Patch Review"). I love
system programming, computer architecture, and other low-level details surrounding compilers.

When I have the time, I love playing and competing at local pinball arcades, practicing electric guitar and bass,
reading non-fiction books, and analyzing code generation on Godbolt\'s [Compiler Explorer.](https://godbolt.org/ "Compiler Explorer")
