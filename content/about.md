Hello! My name is **Micah Weston** and I am an Honors Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I will be graduating May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science and two co-ops. After that I will complete a Master of Science in Computer Science within a year.

At university, I contribute code to a Multi-GPU simulator used for research. This opportunity was possible through the mentoring I received from grad students of the _NU Computer Architecture Research Lab_. 

On top of research, I've started contributing to LLVM with the submission of my first patch for a [machine instruction combine in the AArch64 backend](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116468 "LLVM Patch Review"). For extracurriculars, I am a member of IEEE's Eta Kappa Nu and the Husky Competitive Programming Club. When I have the time, I love playing electric guitar and bass, reading non-fiction books, and analyzing code generation on Godbolt\'s [Compiler Explorer.](https://godbolt.org/ "Compiler Explorer")

Once I graduate, I hope to become a compiler engineer or software engineer. However, I have not completely ruled out becoming a guitarist in a metal band.
