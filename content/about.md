Hello! My name is **Micah Weston** and I am an Honors Computer Engineering and Computer Science student at Northeastern University. I will be graduating May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science and two co-ops. After that I will complete a Master of Science in Computer Science within a year.

At university, I am doing research on _Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)_ design to improve hit rates through the coalescing of contiguous address entries. This research has been possible through the mentoring I have received from grad students from the _NU Computer Architecture Research Lab_. 

On top of research, I am the social media manager for _NU Motorsports_ and the treasurer for _NU Sound_. When I have the time, I love playing electric guitar and bass, taking care of my plants, and put various code and algorithms into Matt Godbolt\'s [Compiler Explorer.](https://godbolt.org/ "Compiler Explorer")

Once I graduate, I hope to become a compiler engineer or software engineer focusing on high performance code. However, I have not completely ruled out becoming a guitarist in a metal band.
